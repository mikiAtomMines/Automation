File:                       a_out_scan.py

Library Call Demonstrated:  mcculw.ul.a_out_scan()

Purpose:                    Writes to a range of D/A Output Channels.

Demonstration:              Sends a digital output to the D/A channels

Other Library Calls:        mcculw.ul.win_buf_alloc()
                            mcculw.ul.win_buf_free()
                            mcculw.ul.get_status()
                            mcculw.ul.release_daq_device()

Special Requirements:       Device must have D/A converter(s).
                            This function is designed for boards that
                            support timed analog output.  It can be used
                            for polled output boards but only for values
                            of NumPoints up to the number of channels
                            that the board supports (i.e., NumPoints =
                            6 maximum for the six channel CIO-DDA06).
